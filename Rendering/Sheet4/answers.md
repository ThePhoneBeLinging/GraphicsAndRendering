## Part 1 - Elias
A small 25 W light bulb has an efficiency of 20%. How many photons are approximately emitted per second?
Assume in the calculations that we only use average photons of wavelength 500 nm.

$E = 6.626 * 10^{-34} * 500 = 3.313e-31 Js $

## Part 2 - Emil
A light bulb (2.4 V and 0.7 A), which is approximately sphere-shaped with a diameter of 1 cm, emits light
equally in all directions. Find the following entities (ideal conditions assumed)
- Radiant flux
- Radiant intensity
- Radiant exitance
- Emitted energy in 5 minutes
  Use W for Watt, J for Joule, m for meter, s for second and sr for steradian
