    <h1>Sheet9 - Part 5 - Elias</h1>
    <p>
        Projection shadows are attractive because they are extremely simple: we analytically project the caster 
        onto a plane, so there is no extra render pass, no additional textures, and the performance cost is tiny. 
        This simplicity also means there are severe limitations. Projection shadows only work for planar receivers,
        they cannot produce self-shadowing, they always yield hard silhouettes, and the technique breaks down
        when the scene has multiple receivers or curved surfaces. Shadow mapping, by contrast, renders the scene 
        from the light's perspective and stores depth in a texture. This extra pass and texture memory introduce 
        overhead and bring well-known artifacts such as aliasing, bias tuning, and filtering requirements, 
        yet the benefits outweigh the drawbacks in most general scenes. Shadow mapping supports arbitrary 
        receivers, self-shadowing, and can be extended with filtering to approximate soft shadows, which makes 
        it far more versatile than projection shadows despite its higher implementation and tuning cost.
